# Validation & Errors in Taskman

## ✅ Why Validation Matters
Right now, your app trusts a lot of incoming data:
- Users could POST a task with no `description`, or a `priority` of `"Banana"`.
- A malicious client could send extra fields (`isAdmin: true`) and your Mongoose schema might ignore them… or not.
- Dates could be invalid (`dueDate: "not-a-date"`), breaking UI sorting.
- Empty email or too-short passwords could slip into your DB if your controller misses a check.

Validation solves this by acting as a **gatekeeper**:  
- **On the client:** catch mistakes instantly, show friendly error messages.  
- **On the server:** enforce integrity, security, and prevent bad data from ever reaching MongoDB.

## 🔐 Features with Zod (client-side)
- **Instant feedback:** User sees “Task is required” without waiting for a network round trip.  
- **Strong typing:** Zod schemas infer TypeScript types automatically.  
- **Safe transforms:** Automatically cast `"2025-09-01"` into a `Date` object.  
- **Complex validation rules:** min/max lengths, enums (`Low | Medium | High`), regex for email.  
- **Reusable schemas:** validate forms, URL query params, and API requests with the same definition.

## 🔒 Features with express-validator (server-side)
- **Final protection layer:** enforces rules for requests from *any* client (browser, Postman, curl).  
- **Sanitization:** trims whitespace, escapes HTML (XSS prevention).  
- **Custom rules:** e.g. “priority must be one of Low/Medium/High.”  
- **Error shaping:** consistent error responses (`[{ field: "email", message: "Invalid email" }]`).  
- **Integration with routes:** attach specific validators per endpoint.

## 🎯 Benefits to Taskman
1. **Data consistency**  
   - Tasks always have valid `status`.  
   - Dates are real dates.  
   - Labels are always arrays of strings.  

2. **Better UX**  
   - Users can’t submit empty tasks.  
   - Errors show next to fields instead of a generic message.  

3. **Security**  
   - Prevents malicious input (`<script>` or unexpected fields like `role=admin`).  
   - Rejects oversized payloads before they reach MongoDB.  

4. **Developer productivity**  
   - Less debugging “undefined priority” errors.  
   - Shared schemas avoid duplication (Zod gives both types + runtime checks).  

5. **Future-proofing**  
   - Easy to add rules (e.g. max 5 labels per task).  
   - Reusable for mobile clients or external APIs.

## 👉 In Short
- **Zod** → Provides **instant, type-safe validation** in Next.js (client and optionally server).  
- **express-validator** → Provides **express-specific request validation** on the backend.  

**Together = polished UX + hardened backend.**
